# TenK10K phase1 multiome data processing

TenK10K is a population cohort that will profile single-cell RNA-seq data of ~50 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10,000 individuals in Australia. This cohort will collect
- 5,000 healthy donors, an extended version of the [OneK1K cohort](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3041)
- 2,000 individuals with coronary artery disease, the [BioHeart cohort](https://www.heartresearch.com.au/research/bioheart/)
- 1,500 individuals from a pan-autoimmune disease cohort, the [AIM study](https://www.mrc.unsw.edu.au/australian-inflammatory-bowel-disease-microbiome-study)
- 1,500 individuals from a pan-cancer cohort, the LBIO study
- 600 individuals from a long-covid cohort, the [ADAPT study](https://www.svhs.org.au/research-education/participating-in-research-trials/adapt-study)

<!-- potentially also from [HOPE Research Program](https://www.garvan.org.au/research/collaboration/hope-research) -->
This repository will contain the analysis code for computational and statistical analyses of TenK10K, with a focus on caQTL (i.e., SNPs associated with chromatin accessibility levels) and multi-omics integration.
